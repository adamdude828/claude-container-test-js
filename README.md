# The Flash

In crimson blur he races through the night,
A streak of lightning splitting through the dark,
The Scarlet Speedster, faster than light,
Leaving behind only his thunder's mark.

Through Central City's streets he weaves and turns,
Protecting those who cannot match his pace,
While Speed Force energy within him burns,
He fights for justice with unwavering grace.

Barry Allen, man of science true,
Struck by lightning, changed forevermore,
Now runs where only gods and legends flew,
A hero's heart that nothing can ignore.

When evil threatens and hope seems lost,
The Flash arrives, no matter what the cost.
