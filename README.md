# Superman

High above the city's gleaming towers,
A figure soars with matchless powers,
Cape flowing red against the sky,
The Man of Steel goes flying by.

From distant Krypton, last of his kind,
With strength of body, heart, and mind,
He guards the earth with gentle care,
A beacon of hope beyond compare.

When darkness threatens, when evil calls,
When innocent victims fear they'll fall,
Superman answers, swift and true,
Protecting me, protecting you.

Not just his strength or piercing gaze,
But compassion guides him through his days,
A symbol bright upon his chest,
Reminds us all to be our best.

So when the world seems dark and cold,
Remember tales that have been told,
Of one who chose to stand and fight,
To be the world's enduring light.

## Haiku

Red cape flows through sky  
Man of Steel protects us all  
Hope soars above earth

# The Flash

Scarlet speedster, lightning's child,
Through time and space, forever wild,
Faster than thought, quicker than light,
A crimson blur, defender bright.

Barry Allen, touched by storm,
Speed Force flows through flesh reborn,
Central City's guardian true,
Racing when there's work to do.

In microseconds, lives he saves,
While yellow streak behind him waves,
Through dimensions he can dart,
Science mixed with hero's heart.

When villains plot and chaos reigns,
The Flash appears through Speed Force veins,
Vibrating through the fabric thin,
Of reality, to always win.

Not just speed defines his way,
But hope he brings to every day,
For fastest man alive knows well,
That time's a gift, not chains of hell.
