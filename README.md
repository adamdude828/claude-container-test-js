# Superman

## A Hero's Flight

From Krypton's distant, dying star,
A child was sent both near and far,
To Earth he came with powers bright,
A beacon in the darkest night.

With cape of red and chest of steel,
He soars above with heart so real,
Through Metropolis he flies with grace,
A smile upon his noble face.

When danger calls and hope seems lost,
He answers, never counting cost,
For truth and justice guide his way,
Superman saves another day.
