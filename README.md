# Superman

High above the city's gleaming towers,
A figure soars with matchless powers,
Cape flowing red against the sky,
The Man of Steel goes flying by.

From distant Krypton, last of his kind,
With strength of body, heart, and mind,
He guards the earth with gentle care,
A beacon of hope beyond compare.

When darkness threatens, when evil calls,
When innocent victims fear they'll fall,
Superman answers, swift and true,
Protecting me, protecting you.

Not just his strength or piercing gaze,
But compassion guides him through his days,
A symbol bright upon his chest,
Reminds us all to be our best.

So when the world seems dark and cold,
Remember tales that have been told,
Of one who chose to stand and fight,
To be the world's enduring light.

## Haiku

Red cape flows through sky  
Man of Steel protects us all  
Hope soars above earth
