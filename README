# The Flash

Lightning strikes across the sky so bright,
A crimson blur that breaks the speed of light,
Through Central City streets he races fast,
Each second stretched, each moment seems to last.

The Flash, protector of all time and space,
With speedforce flowing through his quickened pace,
He saves the day when darkness starts to fall,
The fastest man alive, he conquers all.
