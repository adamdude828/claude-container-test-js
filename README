# The Flash

In crimson streaks across the night,
A hero moves with speed of light,
Through Central City's streets he races,
Saving souls from danger's faces.

Barry Allen, struck by chance,
With lightning's gift, a cosmic dance,
The fastest man alive they say,
Who turns the dark of night to day.

With every step, time bends and breaks,
For those he loves, what'er it takes,
The Flash, a beacon burning bright,
A guardian of hope and light.
